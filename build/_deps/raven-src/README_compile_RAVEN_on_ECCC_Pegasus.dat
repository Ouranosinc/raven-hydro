How to get Raven compiled on Pegasus

------------------------------------

Adjustments need to be done in the Makefile of Raven such that
it finds the NetCDF library on Pegasus. There are multiple installations.
I have chosen the one under:
/ssm/net/hpcs/201402/03-test/intel13sp1u2/ubuntu-14.04-amd64-64

(1) Revise CXXFLAGS from

    	   CXXFLAGS := -Wno-deprecated 

    to

           CXXFLAGS := -Wno-deprecated  -I/ssm/net/hpcs/201402/03-test/intel13sp1u2/ubuntu-14.04-amd64-64/include

(2) Revise LDLIBS from

    	   LDLIBS := -L/usr/local -lnetcdf

    to

	   LDLIBS := -L/ssm/net/hpcs/201402/03-test/intel13sp1u2/ubuntu-14.04-amd64-64/lib -lnetcdf


That's it!
